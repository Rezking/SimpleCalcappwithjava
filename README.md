# SimpleCalculatorappwithjava
I just started learning java and this app was in teaching it. I decided to work further with it by trying how to integrate java applications to GitHuB and how to use the .gitignore file
This is a CLI app that performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

To compile the app,launch a terminal and go to the directory that has the Main.java file. Run

`javac Main.java`

This creates a Main.class file in that directory, and to run it; use the command

`java com.pluralsight.Main Interactively`

Happy Coding!
